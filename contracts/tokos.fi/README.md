## Reverse engineering
On testnet, I have had to reverse engineer everything.
The mainnet contract addresses are [here](https://docs.tokos.fi/deployed-contracts)

I am assuming the ABI of AAVE V3 is similar enough to tokos, or that tokos just
uses aave under the hood enough, for the [Wrapped Token Gateway V3 ABI](./WrappedTokenGatewayV3.json)
to be compatible.
